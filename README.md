# Log4j-minecraft-exploit
Main Contributors: Jacob Aragon and Chase Lathrop

We use kali linux and ubuntu to configure a vulnerable version of a minecraft server running log4j. We then use tools like nmap, john the ripper, etc to enumerate and exploit the target and perform privilege escalation for our Fullstack Academy Cyber Bootcamp 2022 final project.
