Software Configuration
Java 1.8.0_181
The /usr/environment directory should look like:
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/jre/bin" J2SDKDIR="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181" J2REDIR=""/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/jre" JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181"

Then run these commands to update alternatives:
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/bin/java" 0 
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/bin/java" 0 
sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_181/bin/java

Minecraft Server
https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.8.8/builds/443/downloads/paper-1.8.8-443.jar
Above is where the legacy download of minecraft servers are located.

sudo java -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar ~/Downloads/paper-1.8.8-443.jar
This starts up the vulnerable minecraft server that will be hosting our vulnerable game instance that will be carrying out the log4j exploit.

Creating an instance in the server:
New instance > server IP address (0 for localhost) 
Type “t” in-game to pull up the communication block where the injection point is for log4j.
